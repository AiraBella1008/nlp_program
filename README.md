I developed a Python program that performs Natural Language Processing (NLP) on text.

The program uses NLTK to tokenize text into words and remove common stopwords.

It applies TextBlob to analyze sentiment, measuring polarity and subjectivity.

The program uses spaCy to detect named entities like people, organizations, and locations.

I implemented a keyword extraction feature using Python’s Counter to find the most frequent words.

The program outputs cleaned tokens, sentiment scores, detected entities, and top keywords.

I downloaded necessary NLTK datasets (punkt and stopwords) and the spaCy English model.

The project demonstrates how basic NLP techniques can extract meaning from text.

It can be extended to handle user input or analyze large documents for practical applications.

This project showcases skills in text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, NER, and Python programming.                          
Purpose: The purpose of this project is to analyze and understand text automatically by performing preprocessing, 
sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and keyword extraction, demonstrating how NLP techniques can extract meaningful information from written content.
